# Automatic-Water-Management-System

1. Level Control :- Automatic water tank level control system for underground and overhead tank. The level of water in tanks is measured through ultrasonic sensor, that constantly sends data to MCU which displays the level on LCD screen. Underground water pump turns automatically ON & OFF upon level of water in overhead tank.

2.	Measurement :- Flow sensor in pipeline continuously measures flow rate and measured consumption. It is interfaced to microcontroller giving it live data that is displayed on LCD screen. 

3.	Wastage Detection & Prevention :- Flow sensor detects water wastage in open unmonitored taps. Sends the feedback to MCU. Then MCU commands a solenoid valve to turn OFF in a particular water pipeline to shut off water supply thereby preventing water wastage.

4.	Notification :- MCU sends message to the userâ€™s phone using GSM technology notifying the user of an open water tap in the premises. User can later close the tap and restore the water supply.
